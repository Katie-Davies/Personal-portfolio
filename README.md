# Personal Project

This was my original personal portfolio but after having issues with deploying on Azure I created on a new template without a server to see if that was the issue. This is now incase I want to add my own db in the future. 

Please see [deployed Portfolio](https://github.com/Katie-Davies/portfolio)

# Boilerplate: React with Express and Vite

This is a starter project that uses Vite to bundle a React app and Express to serve it in production. Express is used in development to serve an API server.

Vite React App: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
Express API Server: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Requests to `http://localhost:5173/api` are proxied to `http://localhost:3000/api`.

## Setup

### Installation

To use, consider these steps:

- Fork this repo
- Rename your repo according to the app you're building

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[your-account]/[your-app].git
cd [your-app] && npm i

```

To start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds your code, run `npm run dev`.

Additional components should be placed in `client/components`.
